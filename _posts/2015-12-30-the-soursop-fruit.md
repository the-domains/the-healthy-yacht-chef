The Soursop is a green tropical fruit with a sweet and creamy flesh. Great to eat on it's own, just pick off the skin and spit out the seeds, or use it as a flavouring enhancing base to sorbets, vegan nice creams and smoothies.  By the way...let it get nice and ripe letting the skin turn brown and you will be rewarded with an even more intense flavour.
